Terraform modules to manage AWS and local home server infrastructure

# ‚òÅÔ∏è Terraform Infrastructure Modules

This repository contains Terraform modules, documentation, and visual architecture assets for deploying a **hybrid infrastructure platform** supporting both **cloud (AWS)** and **on-premise** environments.  
It is organized into modular components for reusability and clarity across deployment layers, including networking, containerized applications, data warehouses, and user authentication services.

## üöÄ Overview

This repository supports both **cloud-native** and **on-premise** infrastructure deployments using Terraform.  
Each module is self-contained and reusable, making it possible to mix and match configurations depending on the environment.

Key features:
- Modular design for AWS and on-prem environments  
- Infrastructure-as-code using Terraform  
- Visual documentation for system design and networking  
- Integrated documentation site built with MkDocs
